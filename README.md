## 🎯 **Business Understanding**

The demand for renewable energy is growing rapidly, driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on non-renewable energy sources. Among renewable energy sources, solar energy has been gaining popularity due to its eco-friendliness and cost-effectiveness. Solar panels generate electricity by converting sunlight into energy and do not emit any harmful greenhouse gases. However, the performance of a solar panel system can be affected by various factors, such as shading, temperature, dust, and aging. These factors can reduce the efficiency of the system and lead to lower power output.

## 💡 **Problem Statement**

The problem of inefficient utilization of solar energy is prevalent in many households and off-shore solar plants, especially in developing countries. Most households and plants do not have a reliable system to monitor and control the energy generated from solar panels, resulting in wastage and under-utilization of the energy.
